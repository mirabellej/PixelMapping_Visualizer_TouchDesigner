# PixelMapping_Visualizer_TouchDesigner
A visualizer for pixel mapping in TouchDesigner. Automarically updates layout based on input of matrix dimensions. Manual gradient animator with slider for speed and color picker implementation. Takes in a single color constant, animated gradient ramp, or video file and translates color / layout data into DMX output for real-time accurate visualization. Perfect for single strand LEDs or smaller matrixes.   

Designed for use with Advatek Pixlite controller, but any controller should work.
Make certain in the DMX Out Chop that the IP of your controller and the IP of your computer match what is listed. 
You can check this using the Advatek Assistant Software which will warn you if your computer and controller are not on the same IP. The first three sets of numbers for the controller and computer should be the same, and the last set should be different. For example:
Computer IP: 10.0.0.8
Controller IP: 10.0.0.9

You will need to update the video files in each video device in. I recommend using moving wallpaper videos, but any video with lots of color and shifting patterns will do.
